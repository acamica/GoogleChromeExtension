# Google Chrome Extension to keep learning HTML and CSS

The extension shows a different HTML tag or CSS property every time you open a new tab. The tag or property comes with a description and an example to help you discover it.

## Goals of the extension:
- To generate implicit learning (i.e. unconscious learning without any effort, through simple repetitions).
- To arouse curiosity
- To consolidate knowledge
- To enhance life-long learning
- To encourage learn on a continuous basis
